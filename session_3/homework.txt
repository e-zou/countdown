This week, you will be working on creating a very basic react app that utilizes buttons to update and display state. Your task before next Wednesday is to add three more buttons to your app:
- One that decrements your count
- One that multiplies your count by some number
- One that has some other functionality of your choosing (get creative!)

There will be a working solution of the counter app in the repo that we built in Countdown today that you may use as a reference in case you did not get yours up and running in class.
